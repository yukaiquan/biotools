## 1. Fasta rename

'''fasta_rename''' is a simple script to rename fasta sequences. It takes a fasta file and a tab-delimited file with the old and new names as input and outputs a new fasta file with the new names.

#### Usage

```bash
./fastaRename example/test.fasta example/renam_hash.txt example/fasta_rename_out.fasta
```

- example/test.fasta is the input fasta file
- example/renam_hash.tx is the tab-delimited file with the old and new names
- example/fasta_rename_out.fasta is the output fasta file
