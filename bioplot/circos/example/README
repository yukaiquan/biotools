EXAMPLE

This is an example that demonstrates many features of Circos,
including some advanced such as track automation. Use this example to
verify that your installation is working and as an introduction to the
configuration file syntax.

*** Don't use this configuration file as a template for
*** your projects if you are new to Circos. Instead, use the 
*** Quick Start tutorial and refer to the Best Practices
***

The example uses relative paths in the configuration file. You need to
run the example from this directory. Read more about relative/absolute
paths in data file names here.

Use the online tutorials (see below) to learn about configuration syntax.

To create the image, execute the 'run' script (UNIX)

> ./run

The image takes ~60 seconds to generate on a 3.33GHz GHz Intel Xeon
X5680 machine. Most of it spent arranging labels in the gene name text
track. See run.out for what to expect.

For Windows users, please see

to learn how to run Circos. To run the example on Windows

> perl ..\bin\circos -conf etc/circos.conf -debug_group summary,timer
