AA028339	GO:0010114	biological_process	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a red light stimulus. Red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength of 580-700nm. An example of this response is seen at the beginning of many plant species developmental stages. These include germination, and the point when cotyledon expansion is triggered. In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs.	362	230	353	6.3E-99

This process does not remove the replication-blocking lesions but does not causes an increase in the endogenous mutation level. For S. cerevisiae, RAD30 encodes DNA polymerase eta, which incorporates two adenines. When incorporated across a thymine-thymine dimer, it does not increase the endogenous mutation level.	1130	6	1129	0.0

The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II contains an essential carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) composed of a variable number of heptapeptide repeats (YSPTSPS). The remainder of the complex is composed of smaller subunits (generally ten or more), some of which are also found in RNA polymerases I and III.

Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process.

In general this process consists of three phases: biogenesis of siRNAs, scaffold RNA production, and the formation of the guiding complex that recruits de novo DNA methyltransferases to the target loci.
